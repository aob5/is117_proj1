        <h1>Tutorial 1: WebStorm Basics</h1>
        <p>This tutorial will explain step by step on how to setup WebStorm and connect with the Andrew File System
          (AFS)!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step1.png" alt="Step 1" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 1:</h2>
          <p>If you haven't already done so, download and install the WebStorm application to get started. Once
            installed, open it and click on "Create New Project".</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step2.png" alt="Step 2" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 2:</h2>
          <p>Give a name to your new WebStorm project, and select the most recent version if possible. Then, click the
            blue "Create" button in the bottom right corner.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step3.png" alt="Step 3" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 3:</h2>
          <p>You will now see your project opened. To get started on logging into AFS, go to the "Tools" dropdown menu,
            and select the "Start SSH session..." option.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step4.png" alt="Step 4" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 4:</h2>
          <p>From here, you can simply login by providing a host name, your user credentials, and a port number. After
            providing that information, click on the blue "OK" button in the bottom right corner.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step5.png" alt="Step 5" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 5:</h2>
          <p>You will now see a sub-window showing your full access to the remote terminal from AFS. This terminal is
            typically used to control files and folders from AFS remotely.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">

        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 6:</h2>
          <p>Now, if you want to simulate the files and folders physically shown on AFS, you can do that by heading to
            the "Tools" dropdown menu, selecting the "Deployment" submenu, and then selecting the "Configuration..."
            option.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step7.png" alt="Step 7" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 7:</h2>
          <p>From here, you will want to click on the "+" symbol up at the top left corner, and select a connection
            protocol as a means to connect to the AFS network remotely.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step8.png" alt="Step 8" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 8:</h2>
          <p>Provide a name for the connection you are attempting to set up, then click on the blue "OK" button in the
            bottom right corner.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step9.png" alt="Step 9" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 9:</h2>
          <p>You will return to this window again, but now will be asked to provide information about the network you
            are attempting to connect to. Similarly to the SSH session login, provide a host name, port number, and user
            credentials. Also, provide any other links on the root path and web server url for any other configuration
            purposes. Now go ahead and click on the "Mappings" tab above.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step10.png" alt="Step 10" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 10:</h2>
          <p>From here, you will want to set the paths to which files and folders will be deployed onto and from AFS to
            the web. After everything is done being configured, click on the blue "OK" button in the bottom right
            corner.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step11.png" alt="Step 11" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 11:</h2>
          <p>You will now see on the right hand side a sub-window of the physical files and folders that appear on your
            AFS account. For better security, we would always want to make sure that when working on the local side, any
            files and folders used from the local storage gets sent automatically to the AFS side simultaneously. For
            that reason, head to the "Tools" dropdown menu for one last time, select the "Deployment" submenu, and then
            select the "Automatic Upload" option from there.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wsContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/webstorm_tutorial1/step12.png" alt="Step 12" />
        <div class="wsContent_right">
          <h2>Step 12:</h2>
          <p>Now that "Automatic Upload" is set, initiate your first upload to AFS in order to start the automatic
            deployment. To do so, right-click whichever file you wish to upload to AFS, select the "Deployment" submenu
            option, then select the "Upload to AFS" option. You will now have successfully uploaded your files while
            making the automatic deployment active for your project.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Web Browser</td>
      <td>
        <p>A web browser, or simply "browser," is an application used to access and view websites. The primary function
          of a web browser is to render HTML, the code used to design or "mark up" webpages. Each time a browser loads a
          web page, it processes the HTML, which may include text, links, and references to images and other items, such
          as cascading style sheets and JavaScript functions. The browser processes these items, then renders them in
          the browser window.</p>

          system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
          "Hypertext" refers to the hyperlinks that an HTML page may contain. "Markup language" refers to the way tags
          are used to define the page layout and elements within the page.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>CSS</td>
      <td>
        <p>Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They
          can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be
          defined in a page's HTML. It is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and
          variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>File</td>
      <td>
        <p>In WebStorm, you can create files with language-specific extensions and some initial contents, thanks to file
          templates for most of the languages supported by the IDE. File templates are specifications of the default
          contents to be generated when creating a new file. Depending on the type of file you are creating, templates
          provide initial code and formatting that is expected to be in all files of that type (according to industry
          standards, your corporate policy, or for other reasons). WebStorm provides predefined templates for all
          supported file types, which are suggested when you are creating a new file.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Folder / Directory</td>
      <td>
        <p>In WebStorm, content is a collection of files with which you are currently working, possibly organized in a
          hierarchy of subfolders. The top-level folder of a project is its content root. You can add any folder as a
          part of your project. In the Settings/Preferences dialog, click Directories. The Directories page opens. To
          add a content root, click Add Content Root in the right-hand pane and then select the required folder in the
          dialog that opens.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>AFS</td>
      <td>
        <p>The Andrew File System (AFS) is the primary academic computing environment at NJIT. AFS is a distributed file
          system comprised of multiple file and database servers and several hundred MacOS, Linux, Unix, and Windows
          client computers. A very wide spectrum of both open source and commercial applications, compilers, libraries,
          and utilities is available in AFS. NJIT calls our AFS file system Highlander AFS for unique branding purposes.
          Highlander AFS uses your UCID login and password. To best access Highlander AFS services, your computer should
          be an AFS client.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Rules for Naming Files and Folders on the Web</td>
      <td>
        <p>Filenames are part of your URL—and therefore an important part of your HTML. You can name your file nearly
          anything you choose, but you must follow a few rules of thumb to ensure that it displays correctly: don’t use
          special characters, don’t use spaces, start the file name with a letter, use all lowercase letters, keep your
          filenames short, and remember the file extension.</p>
