    <tr>
      <td>Terminal</td>
      <td>
        <p>An emulator for working with a command-line shell from inside the IDE. Having a command line right inside the
          IDE lets you do things like running Git commands, and so on without switching windows and mental focus when
          you need to perform a quick command line task.</p>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>WebStorm</td>
      <td>
        <p>A powerful and intelligent IDE that gives you the best coding assistance for JavaScript, HTML and CSS and a
          wide range of modern web technologies. WebStorm is perfectly equipped for complex client-side development and
          server-side development with Node.js. It provides smart code insight, autocompletion, refactoring features,
          on-the-fly error prevention, and much more. Together with support for the popular frameworks such as AngularJS
          and Meteor and integrated instruments for testing, debugging and code analysis and integration with various
          VCS, WebStorm enhances your productivity and takes your development experience to a whole new level.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</td>
      <td>
        <p>A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software
          development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a
          debugger.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>HTML5 Boilerplate</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Grunt</td>
      <td>
        <p>An ecosystem that WebStorm parses grunt files in to recognizing definitions of tasks and targets, shows tasks
          and targets in a tree view, lets you navigate between a task or a target in the tree and its definition in the
          grunt file, and supports running and debugging tasks and targets.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Linux</td>
      <td>
        <p>A Unix-like, open source and community-developed operating system for computers, servers, mainframes, mobile
          devices and embedded devices. Every version of the Linux operating system manages hardware resources, launches
          and handles applications, and provides some form of user interface.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>HTTP</td>
      <td>
        <p>HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this
          protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should
          take in response to various commands.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Web Browser</td>
      <td>
        <p>A web browser, or simply "browser," is an application used to access and view websites. The primary function
          of a web browser is to render HTML, the code used to design or "mark up" webpages. Each time a browser loads a
          web page, it processes the HTML, which may include text, links, and references to images and other items, such
          as cascading style sheets and JavaScript functions. The browser processes these items, then renders them in
          the browser window.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>HTML</td>
      <td>
        <p>Stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." HTML is the language used to create webpages. It is a standardized
          system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
          "Hypertext" refers to the hyperlinks that an HTML page may contain. "Markup language" refers to the way tags
          are used to define the page layout and elements within the page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>CSS</td>
      <td>
        <p>Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They
          can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be
          defined in a page's HTML. It is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and
          variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Login</td>
      <td>
        <p>In the remote server configuration, a server runs on another computer (a remote host). To access files on the
          server, login the remote server using any of the FTP/SFTP/FTPS protocols.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>File</td>
      <td>
        <p>In WebStorm, you can create files with language-specific extensions and some initial contents, thanks to file
          templates for most of the languages supported by the IDE. File templates are specifications of the default
          contents to be generated when creating a new file. Depending on the type of file you are creating, templates
          provide initial code and formatting that is expected to be in all files of that type (according to industry
          standards, your corporate policy, or for other reasons). WebStorm provides predefined templates for all
          supported file types, which are suggested when you are creating a new file.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Folder / Directory</td>
      <td>
        <p>In WebStorm, content is a collection of files with which you are currently working, possibly organized in a
          hierarchy of subfolders. The top-level folder of a project is its content root. You can add any folder as a
          part of your project. In the Settings/Preferences dialog, click Directories. The Directories page opens. To
          add a content root, click Add Content Root in the right-hand pane and then select the required folder in the
          dialog that opens.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>AFS</td>
      <td>
        <p>The Andrew File System (AFS) is the primary academic computing environment at NJIT. AFS is a distributed file
          system comprised of multiple file and database servers and several hundred MacOS, Linux, Unix, and Windows
          client computers. A very wide spectrum of both open source and commercial applications, compilers, libraries,
          and utilities is available in AFS. NJIT calls our AFS file system Highlander AFS for unique branding purposes.
          Highlander AFS uses your UCID login and password. To best access Highlander AFS services, your computer should
          be an AFS client.</p>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Rules for Naming Files and Folders on the Web</td>
      <td>
        <p>Filenames are part of your URLâ€”and therefore an important part of your HTML. You can name your file nearly
          anything you choose, but you must follow a few rules of thumb to ensure that it displays correctly: donâ€™t use
          special characters, donâ€™t use spaces, start the file name with a letter, use all lowercase letters, keep your
          filenames short, and remember the file extension.</p>
