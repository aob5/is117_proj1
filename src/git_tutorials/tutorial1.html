        <h1>Tutorial 1: Git Basics</h1>
        <p>This tutorial will explain step by step on how to use Git to make repositories of code material, to make a
          commit from WebStorm, and to make a branch on GitHub!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial1/step1.PNG" alt="Step 1"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 1:</h2>
          <p>To get started, make an account on GitHub by clicking on the "Sign up" button at the top corner and
            following the instructions on the sign up page.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial1/step2.PNG" alt="Step 2"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 2:</h2>
          <p>After you've made an account, in order to begin on repositories, you should click on the "Your repositores"
            link shown on the dropdown menu in the top right corner.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial1/step3.PNG" alt="Step 3"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 3:</h2>
          <p>You will then be led to a page which would contain a history of all your repositories for your account. To
            make a new repository, click on the green "New" button on the top right corner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 4:</h2>
          <p>You will then be setting up your first repository on this page. Once you finish configuring your
            repository, click on the "Create repository" button in the bottom left corner.</p>

        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 5:</h2>
          <p>As you can see, you're currently on the page of your repository. Now you have the ability to utilize it for
            coding purposes. To get started with using it, click on the green "Clone or download" button in the top
            right corner to show a link that you'll need to copy over to WebStorm.</p>

          <h2>Step 6:</h2>
          <p>Back on WebStorm, go to the VCS drop down menu from the top, and select the "Enable Version Control

        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 7:</h2>
          <p>Once here, just make sure that "Git" is selected as one of the dropdown selections, and click the "OK"
            button.</p>

        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 13:</h2>
          <p>From here, you want to make sure that all files in which you want pushed up into the repository are
            selected on the top left corner of the new window. You will also need to leave a commit message to address
            the change being made to the repository. Afterwards, once you finish configuring your commit, click on the
            "Commit" button on the bottom right corner.</p>

      <td>Definition:</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Repository</td>
      <td>
        <p>A Git repository is the folder where you are storing all the files related to your project. This repository
          tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Clone</td>
      <td>
        <p>A Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the
          target repository.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Fork</td>
      <td>
        <p>A copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting
          the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to
          use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Branch</td>
      <td>
        <p>A lightweight movable pointer to a commit. The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making
          commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the
          master branch pointer moves forward automatically.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Commit</td>
      <td>
        <p>An individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time
          you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes
          were made when and by who.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Merge</td>
      <td>
        <p>Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the
          independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Checkout</td>
      <td>
        <p>The act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The git checkout command operates upon
          three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Push</td>
      <td>
        <p>A Git command used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer
          commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching
          imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Pull</td>
      <td>
        <p>A Git command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote. It is one of the four commands
          that prompts network interaction by Git. By default, git pull does two things: updates the current local
          working branch (currently checked out branch), and updates the remote tracking branches for all other
          branches.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Remote Add / Remove / Show</td>
      <td>
        <p>A common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote
          repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. Git remote add is to add
          a "short name", such as origin , and it can be any name as well, which is like an alias to a URL. Conversely,
          Git remote remove would remove a remote. As for the show, it shows which remotes are currently connected and
          provide URLs of remote repositories when listing your current remote connections.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Status</td>
      <td>
        <p>Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been
          staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any
          information regarding the committed project history.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Master Branch</td>
      <td>
        <p>In Git, "master" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote
          server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called "master" branch. This means
          that "master" can be seen as a repository's "default" branch.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Git Ignore</td>
      <td>
        <p>A ".gitignore" file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by
          Git are not affected. Each line in a ".gitignore" file specifies a pattern. When deciding whether to ignore a
          path, Git normally checks ".gitignore" patterns from multiple sources. For example, to ignore the .idea
          folder, the ".gitignore" file must have ".idea" written so that it understands to ignore that particular file
          extension.</p>
      </td>
