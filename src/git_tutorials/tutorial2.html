        <h1>Tutorial 2: Collaborating with Git</h1>
        <p>This tutorial will explain step by step on how to use Git to collaborate with others on the GitHub
          platform!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step1.png" alt="Step 1"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 1:</h2>
          <p>On your repository, click on the "Branch: master" button. A dropdown will appear, in which you will want to
            add a new branch. Go ahead and type a name for a new branch on that dropdown's text box, and hit "Enter" on
            your keyboard.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step2.png" alt="Step 2"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 2:</h2>
          <p>Once that's done, you will now be redirected to your new branch on your repository. From here, since this
            branch is empty and does not have any of the master branch's content, let's click on the "Create new file"
            button to add a file to this branch.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step3.png" alt="Step 3"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 3:</h2>
          <p>Go ahead and make whatever file you like. Once done, click on the green "Create new file" button in the
            bottom right corner.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step4.png" alt="Step 4"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 4:</h2>
          <p>You will now see a file appear on your new branch. Now, in order to have stuff added from this branch back
            to the master, you will need to click on the "New pull request" button.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step5.png" alt="Step 5"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 5:</h2>
          <p>On this page, you will see that the branches that are to be pushing files to each other are the ones
            labeled as "base" and "compare". Make sure that you compare the second branch and make the master branch the
            base. Afterwards, you may also leave a messsage to let the master branch know any viable information that
            might come in handy from this pull request. Once done with all that, go ahead and click on the green "Create
            pull request" button in the bottom right corner.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step6.png" alt="Step 6"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 6:</h2>
          <p>After that, you'll see that the request has been made, and that it's pending a merge of that request. Once
            you confirm that everything has been set up correctly, continue by pressing the green "Merge pull request"
            button below.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step7.png" alt="Step 7"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 7:</h2>
          <p>One more time, confirm the merge by simply clicking the green "Confirm merge" button below.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step8.png" alt="Step 8"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 8:</h2>
          <p>Now the page will say that you have successfully merged your files and/or content from secondary branches
            to the master by indicating you did from the purple "Merged" button on the top right corner. Now, simply
            return to your repository's master branch to see this change yourself.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step9.png" alt="Step 9"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 9:</h2>
          <p>As you can see, the sample file from the second branch has been successfully transferred over onto the
            master branch. Now, for security purposes, you will also want to ensure that no matter what items get
            transferred over from one end, that the other end does so with its items as well so as to keep uniformity
            between all branches. For that reason, we are going to need to repeat steps 4 through 8 again to now merge
            items from the master branch unto the second branch made before. So go ahead and click on the "New pull
            request" button one more time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step10.png" alt="Step 10"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 10:</h2>
          <p>In here, set up your pull request like you did before, except make the compare be master, and the base be
            the second branch (or any and all others for that matter). Once finished, click on the green "Create pull
            request" button in the bottom right corner.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step11.png" alt="Step 11"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 11:</h2>
          <p>And just like before, confirm that everything is as it's supposed to be with this pull request, and
            continue to pressing the green "Merge pull request" button in the bottom right corner.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step12.png" alt="Step 12"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 12:</h2>
          <p>One last time, click on the green "Confirm merge" button below.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step13.png" alt="Step 13"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 13:</h2>
          <p>Now you will see that the page says everything was merged over from the purple indicator button labeled as
            "Merged". Go ahead and revisit your secondary branch one last time to confirm this merge was successful.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="gitContent_instance">
        <img src="../img/git_tutorial2/step14.png" alt="Step 14"/>
        <div class="gitContent_right">
          <h2>Step 14:</h2>
          <p>And there you have it. You can now see that not only did you transfer new files from the second branch to
            master, but you also updated the second branch to have files that were on the master only, ensuring that
            both branches remain uniform.</p>
        </div>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Repository</td>
      <td>
        <p>A Git repository is the folder where you are storing all the files related to your project. This repository
          tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Clone</td>
      <td>
        <p>A Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the
          target repository.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Fork</td>
      <td>
        <p>A copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting
          the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to
          use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Branch</td>
      <td>
        <p>A lightweight movable pointer to a commit. The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making
          commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the
          master branch pointer moves forward automatically.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Commit</td>
      <td>
        <p>An individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time
          you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes
          were made when and by who.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Merge</td>
      <td>
        <p>Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the
          independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Checkout</td>
      <td>
        <p>The act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The git checkout command operates upon
          three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Push</td>
      <td>
        <p>A Git command used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer
          commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching
          imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Pull</td>
      <td>
        <p>A Git command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote. It is one of the four commands
          that prompts network interaction by Git. By default, git pull does two things: updates the current local
          working branch (currently checked out branch), and updates the remote tracking branches for all other
          branches.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Remote Add / Remove / Show</td>
      <td>
        <p>A common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote
          repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. Git remote add is to add
          a "short name", such as origin , and it can be any name as well, which is like an alias to a URL. Conversely,
          Git remote remove would remove a remote. As for the show, it shows which remotes are currently connected and
          provide URLs of remote repositories when listing your current remote connections.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Status</td>
      <td>
        <p>Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been
          staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any
          information regarding the committed project history.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Master Branch</td>
      <td>
        <p>In Git, "master" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote
          server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called "master" branch. This means
          that "master" can be seen as a repository's "default" branch.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Git Ignore</td>
      <td>
        <p>A ".gitignore" file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by
          Git are not affected. Each line in a ".gitignore" file specifies a pattern. When deciding whether to ignore a
          path, Git normally checks ".gitignore" patterns from multiple sources. For example, to ignore the .idea
          folder, the ".gitignore" file must have ".idea" written so that it understands to ignore that particular file
          extension.</p>
